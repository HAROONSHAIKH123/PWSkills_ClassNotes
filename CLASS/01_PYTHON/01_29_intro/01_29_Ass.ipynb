   ]
  },
  {
   "cell_type": "markdown",
   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "Ans: In Python, memory management is handled by the Python interpreter's memory manager. It is responsible for allocating memory for the objects used in the program and freeing up memory that is no longer needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "Python uses a reference counting system to keep track of the number of references to an object. An object's reference count is increased each time it is assigned to a new variable or appended to a list. The memory manager automatically frees up the memory used by an object when its reference count reaches zero, indicating that the object is no longer in use.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, Python has a built-in garbage collector that tracks objects in the system and frees up memory occupied by objects that are no longer accessible from the program. The garbage collector uses a cyclic reference counting algorithm that periodically checks for objects with a reference count of zero and frees up their memory.\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, Python's memory management is transparent to the programmer, and you do not need to worry about freeing up memory or managing memory usage in your programs. The Python interpreter takes care of this automatically."

    "Ans: Yes, indentation is required in Python. Indentation is used to define blocks of code, such as functions, loops, and conditionals. In Python, whitespace is used to indicate the level of nesting in a block of code. Each block of code is indented by the same number of spaces or tabs, and the level of indentation determines the scope of the code.\n",
